  <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Dear Venomfang</h2>

  <p>&emsp;I extend my most gracious greetings to you. It is with great pleasure that I pen these words of appreciation for the commendable success of your recent settlement into your lair at Thundertree. I am pleased to inform you that I have taken every measure to ensure that your establishment is free of any impediments that might hinder your progress as you recover from the regrettable assault by your kin. It is my utmost desire that you find your new abode suitable for your tastes.</p>

  <p>&emsp;As you well know, I have an abiding interest in the area and its environs. Hence, I am especially thankful for your invaluable assistance in providing intelligence on the locality, courtesy of your animal spies. They have provided us with invaluable knowledge of the surrounding topography, enabling us to keep a watchful eye on all interlopers in the region. I believe there is much more to explore and learn about the area, which could be of great value in our future operations and negotiations with other factions.</p>

  <p>&emsp;I have also been apprised of your recent associations with the Zhentarim. Perhaps we could leverage their network to deal with the druid infestation in Thundertree. Their insidious rumors could potentially stir the ire of all who would dare to confront the vermin.</p>

  <p>&emsp;On a different note, I am gravely concerned about the growing power of the goblinoid raiders in the area. It is imperative that we stem their progress, should they become too strong, as they pose an imminent threat to our long-term success in the region. At the very least, most of them are too stupid and focused on simple-minded raiding, and are distracted by their internal squabbles and hierarchies to turn their focus elsewhere, with their raiding being a valuable distraction against our operation. It would be most advantageous if you could monitor their activities and gather any information that could aid in curtailing their rise. Rest assured that we are willing to provide resources and assistance to support your endeavors in this matter.</p>

  <p>&emsp;In closing, please accept my sincerest regards, and I look forward to further collaboration and success in the future.</p>
