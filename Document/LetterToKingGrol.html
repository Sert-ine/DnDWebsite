  <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Dear King Grol</h2>

  <p>&emsp;I trust this message reaches you amidst your affairs, and I hope that your health remains unblemished. I must confess that I write to you today with a heavy heart and no small amount of consternation.</p>

  <p>&emsp;It has come to my attention that you have, in my view, relinquished control over Gundren Rockseeker and the map of Wave Echo Cave to individuals whom I consider beneath both our stations. This turn of events has left me deeply dismayed. This grievous oversight has ensnared my sensibilities in a profound state of disquietude. I had, it appears, entrusted you with a weighty responsibility: to guard these sacrosanct assets and bestow them upon the deserving.</p>
  
  <p>&emsp;However, I am not without patience, King Grol. I do concede, however, that life's vicissitudes can render even the most stalwart of leaders vulnerable to error. Therefore, I extend an opportunity for us to amend this situation.</p>

  <p>&emsp;In acknowledgment of your esteemed leadership and your adherence to principles befitting one of our stature, I extend an opportunity to recalibrate our endeavors with a new arrangement: I am willing to compensate you generously in exchange for the services of your formidable goblinoid warriors and assassins and the safe return of the infant you have collected recently.</p>

<p>&emsp;My network of spies, ever vigilant, has observed your decisive actions in dealing with the adventurers' abandoned wagon near Venomfang's lair. Venomfang, despite his occasional capriciousness, poses no substantial threat to your dominion. His distractions serve us well, as will "Jolana", who left from neverwinter to assist Venomfang on the 27th of Eleasis- 14 days ago.</p>

<p>&emsp;In the remote possibility that these adventurers should return to reclaim the child you now hold due to Venomfang's insistance with toying with threats rather than killing them (oh, how i wish he was instead a blue dragon), be aware of their past deeds—they are the same adversaries responsible for your recent losses. Rest assured, their intentions align with neither our interests nor yours. Your losses, both in terms of lives and pecuniary gains, have reached a lamentable crescendo. Whatever sordid negotiations they may entertain are a pitiful pittance when juxtaposed with the sumptuous rewards I, The Black Spider, am prepared to bestow upon you, in my boundless munificence.</p>

<p>&emsp;Yet, do not mispresume their intentions, as I have divined with utmost certainty, do not include a concord with your esteemed self.</p>

<p>&emsp;I entreat you, therefore, to deliver the infant into my custody, to fortify your defenses with the utmost diligence, and to annihilate these interlopers once and for all. Know that I pledge the entirety of my vast resources and expertise to safeguard your dominion and your eminent position as the paramount leader of the Cragmaw goblins. You have merely 4 days to prepare, and at the time, create a Faux bargin of the return with the child, and ambush them at the right moment.</p>

<p>&emsp;This deal, if executed to perfection, will bring you an even higher reward. Should you successfully eliminate the pests that have interfered with both our plans, I am prepared to offer you an exceptional boon, The details of which shall be revealed during a private audience, to be convened with my envoy, Vyerith. This paragon of my envoys, whom you have encountered previously during discussions regarding the acquisition of the map you so carelessly misplaced, must be accorded the same reverence you would bestow upon my august personage.</p>

<p>&emsp;In concert with this epistle, Vyerith has thoughtfully provided tomes and documents replete with knowledge concerning the individuals who compose the adventuring party. Assiduous study of these materials shall provide you with a decided advantage in the impending conflict.</p>

<p>&emsp;In closing, King Grol, I extend my sincerest regards, for I recognize the great power we may wield together in this region if we rise to meet this pivotal moment.</p>
